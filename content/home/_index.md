### Hi there, welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹

This is the person blog of Zhijun. The main content of this blog will be the data visualization, chemomentrics and application of R & Python & Matlab. I am a PhD Candidate in [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl). My research interest is Food authenticity & Nutrition. The analytical technologies such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI),  stable isotope analysis, gas mass spectrometry combined with Data Science mainly based on [R programming](https://www.r-project.org/) are used to trace the geographical origin and organic certification of agricultural products. Meantime, I also have experiences on functional ingredients of nature plants such as Structural characteristics, antioxidant, immune activity of polysaccharides. I already published more than 8+ [research papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Wang-18).
