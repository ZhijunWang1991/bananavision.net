This is the person blog of Zhijun. I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl). My research interest is Food authenticity & Nutrition. The combination of Analysis technology (hyperspectral imaging, isotope analysis, gas mass spectrometry) and Machine learning based on R/Matlab are used to evaluate the correlation of food quality and growing conditions. Meanwhile, functional ingredients of nature plants are also one of my interests such as Structural characteristics, Antioxidant, Immune activity of foods. I already publised more than 7+ research [papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Wang-18). 

Data visualization, chemomentrics and application of R/Python/Matlab are my interes and nice toll helpful for my PhD. I hope to build a good sysmatic refernces bolg for data analysis in academic writing.
