### Hi there, welcome to my blog! 👋

- 🌾 I’m a PhD Candidate of Food Authenticity and Nutrition at Wageningen Univeristy & Research.

- 👨‍💻 I have been working with the Food Science and Data Science since 2017, during this time I worked with a variety of mass spectrometry, spectral analysis techniques, regression and classification models.

- 🌏 I believe that digital transformation is one of the trends in building sustainable agricultural and food systems.

### 🍌Research Interest

Food fraud, food safety, data science, chemomentrics

### 👩‍🏫Education Background

* 2017-Now, PhD. in Food Fraud and Authentication, Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands

* 2014-2017, Msc in Food Science, Nanchang University, China

* 2011-2013, Second Bsc in Economics, Nanchang University, China

* 2010-2014, Bsc in Food Science, Nanchang University, China

### 💪Research experience

* **Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** and **Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR)** for geographical origin and organic certification of food

* Multiple mass spectrometry techniques such as **GC-MS**, **ICP-MS**, **IR-MS**, **DART-HR-MS** to explore the compositional characteristics of food

* Nutrition evaluation of food for Animal/Human by **Cell Culture** and **animal model**

#### ⚒️Hand-in R

* Developed a *R package* named [**wagedown**](https://github.com/ZhijunWang1991/wagedown), which is adapted from bookdown package. The wagedown package provides a handy template for writing a PhD thesis at Wageningen University and rendering those files in a PDF format. 

* *Data Visualization* with R: Scatter plot, boxplot, heatmap, etc.

* *Regression modelling*: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, prediction based on regression models.

* *Principal component analysis* (PCA) from computing to visualizations.

* *Classification model*: PLS-DA, ANN, random forest  and other Machine learning algorithms.
